#Write your code below this line

#Above we can see new variable c is storing the input value of a (a is empty now)
a = b

#Above we can see a is storing the value of b ( b is empty now)
b = c

#Above we can see b is storing the value of c ( c is empty now)
#Basically we don't care about c variable so we can able to exchange the value of it.
